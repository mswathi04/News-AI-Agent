# CrewAI News Aggregator

This project utilizes CrewAI, a multi-agent platform, to aggregate news articles and generate a final news report on a specified topic. The project involves two agents: `news_researcher` and `news_writer`. These agents communicate with each other to gather information and compile a comprehensive news report.

## Agents

### 1. News Researcher

The `news_researcher` agent is responsible for collecting news articles related to the specified topic. It utilizes various sources and techniques to gather relevant information efficiently.

### 2. News Writer

The `news_writer` agent processes the collected information from the `news_researcher` agent and generates a cohesive news report. It ensures that the final output is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.

## Tasks

- **Collecting News Articles**: The `news_researcher` agent searches for news articles from multiple sources, including online news websites and databases.
  
- **Analyzing and Summarizing**: The collected articles are analyzed and summarized by the `news_researcher` agent to extract key information and insights.
  
- **Generating News Report**: The `news_writer` agent utilizes the summarized information to generate a final news report. It ensures that the report is coherent, informative, and well-organized.
  
- **Communication Between Agents**: Both agents communicate with each other throughout the process to exchange data and coordinate their tasks effectively.
